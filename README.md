Comparison: Flat File Systems vs. Relational Databases
| Feature             | Flat File Systems                                 | Relational Databases                                  |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| **Structure**       | Data stored in plain text or binary files         | Data organized in tables with rows & columns          |
| **Data Redundancy** | High – data often repeated across files           | Low – normalization reduces redundancy                |
| **Relationships**   | No inherent relationships between files           | Foreign keys and joins define relationships           |
| **Example Usage**   | CSV files, log files, Excel spreadsheets          | MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle DB                          |
| **Drawbacks**       | Difficult to scale, update, and query efficiently | Complex setup but highly efficient for large datasets |
